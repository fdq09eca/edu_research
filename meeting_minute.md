## Literature review

The GBA policy inevitably tightens the relationship between GuangDong cities, HK and Macau. With the increasing frequency of cooperation between educational institutions and governments, it is conceivable that the GBA labour market composition would have significant adjustment. For example, cities are expected to develop their specialised labour division so as to improve the economic performance. The change of production, on one hand, surges the demand of the respective talent, on the other hand, it effectively changes the demographic composition

Since change in labour market will be catered by different forms of migration and educational reforms, it generates social changes. The expected migration further spawns various problems such as migrant assimilation, talent development and the cooperation hardship between different political regimes.

Our literature review objectives are identifying these problems and their latest circumstances. In particular:

## Migration, Labour, Human Capital

We look for the following topic in the literature.

- the role of human capital in GBA
- the demographics of the labour market in the GBA
- flow of migrant between in the GBA and their purpose
- the return of education in the GBA

## Children/student health and wellbeing

The parental migration usually affect their next generation daily life drastically. The affected children well-being will be taken into account in our review

- their mental/physical health for the migrant student
- their education performance
- their behaviour

## School support and reform

Given the children well-being is inevitably influenced by the parents' decision, school and governmental supports and additional managements are required to cater the rising need, we will look for the

- their policies and cooperation have been done and their effectiveness
- their policies and cooperation are expected to meet the future challenge
