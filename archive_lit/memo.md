# Labour interaction and mobility between GBA and HK Macau

## Hong Kong towards China

### Labour mobility

While CN migrant in HK has been widely discussed, there are extremely limited discussion about the HK migrant in CN. The only available literatures that give a glance at this matter are Census and Statistics Department (2011a) and Census and Statistics Department (2015). While they are dated references, both have shown that HK labour has limited intention to work in CN in general.

Census and Statistics Department (2011a) discuss the HK labour demographic that used to work in China. It accounted for 5% of the total number of HK labour force, which has declined from its 2004 peak (7.6%) and had had also no significant growth from 1990 to 2010 on average. Nearly 90% of the work/job take place in GuangDong Province.

Amid this particular labour force, over 70% are over 30 years old, more than 2/3 did not received tertiary education; less than 20% are employer, most of them are employee of management level or professionals in manufacturing and trade industry. More than half of the wage level are over HKD 20,000. In contrast, to the same period of HK labour forces, this particular group's median of wage is almost a double of the equivalent in the Hong Kong local labour market (HKD 10,100).

However, their working period in China is ephemeral but frequent. On average, their stay period in China is less than 5 days but they are required to go to China to work at least once a week. It is understandable, since over 90% of them are employed by a HK company and their most frequent reason of working in China are job obligation and career prospect (about 90% and 20% respectively). Limited agreement is found in China employment offers higher wage or lower living cost (both less than 2%).

However, Census and Statistics Department (2015) confirmed that the interaction has been more vivid recently. Investigated 10,100 HK household for the features of HK residents who stayed in China, after 5 years, using working as a reason to travel CN has increased. Moreover, they found HK labour has a longer stay period in CN. In their study, they found that the over a quarter (69,200 observation) of the sample that worked and stayed in CN for at least a month. However, education is still nearly none (0.1%) and leisure or visiting family/relatives still is dominating.

It reflects that the HK labour recently has more participation in the CN labour market, however, this improvement was negligible in term of the total HK labour force proportion and CN education is not appreciated by HK. It is noteworthy that this interaction is mainly contributed by the middle aged and elder, the youth participation was relatively less.

### Education mobility

Census and Statistics Department (2011b) studied the HK students studying outside HK. They found that the most common location of study aboard after 5 years was the typical western countries, for example, UK, US, AU , or CA. CN, however, was ranked to the least intended place of study. Moreover, the main purpose of study aligns with the location decision. over 40% of the reason for studying outside HK was to improve English proficiency, in contrast to around 7% was to improve Putonghua proficiency. In implies that the purpose of study aboard is mainly for the international environment experience. Having said that, 2012 education bureau report show that TW has become popular for aboard study, which accounted for 13% of the over all DSE student study decision. Given the fact that HK, TW and CN has the similar cultural characteristics and speak and write the same language, it shows that HK student prefer TW over CN. Indeed, Although PRC and HKSAR government have been constant promoting the opportunity in CN

Although this report are before the Greater Bay Area Policy initiation, it reflects that HK households have not considered CN as a place for further education traditionally. Having said that, interestingly, the household's median income that could afford study aboard is HKD 35,000 which is more than a double than the overall equivalent. Amid these affluent household, there are about 10% sent their children to CN for education. Despite the number is considerable less that the over population, It implied the CN prospect was appreciated by this middle class parents.

## CN towards to HK

## Migrant

At the contrary of the inactiveness of HK labour towards CN, there has been an increasing trend of interaction from CN towards HK after 1997. Since there has been a large number of migrant from China, the influx of CN labours, and students have become prevalent. According to Press release of HKSAR Government (2017) there is allegedly over 1.5 million Chinese have come to settle in HK. Their settlement has various sources, most commonly they come through the following scheme/arrangement:

1. One Way Permits(OWP)
2. Quality Migrant Admission Scheme
3. Capital Investment Entrant Scheme
4. Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals
5. Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates

Although there has been a slight decrease (2%) in 2016, the number of people entering Hong Kong on OWP has been steadily increasing to its daily maximum (150 people/day) from 1997. Until 2018, the accumulated OWP number has been around 1 million, which accounts for over 13% of the total HK population (Home Affair Department, 2019; Census and Statistics Department 2019).

Moreover, at the end of 2019, 134,291 mainland talent and professionals were admitted under the scheme. Over 90% the approved applications imported workers under the Supplementary Labour Scheme are CN applicant, until 2016 this number has been over 3000, which is 4.4 times of 2002.

Furthermore, CN student has been the dominating the non-local student group in different education sector/institution from 1998 (胡少偉 2015). In particular, in HK high education, the CN student's proportion in total non-local enrollment has been rarely lower than 70% over HK universities, this finding is agreed by Li and Bray (2007b).

## Return of education

Li and Bray (2007b) suggest that HK qualification has been consider as a ladder of upward mobility by CN students, pull factors such as academic and professional growth, economic benefit, individual internationalization, and enhanced social status are taken into account for the CN student to student in HK or Macaus. Surprisingly, they found that CN students studying in HK value the academic achievement over the economic factors such as economic return of their qualification and the competitive ability in the employment market which are CN students studying in Macau mostly concern.

## Well being

### Mental

> For some students in this study, 15% (14), there was the added stress that the future security of their families hinged on their achieving certain specific outcomes and that the cost of funding their cross-border study was an ongoing issue for the family. The pressure to succeed in the shortest amount of time possible was a major concern for this group. This stress led to frequent bouts of sickness and depression --- Peter Bodycott, Ada Lai (2012)
