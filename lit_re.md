# Labour interaction and mobility between GBA and HK Macau

## Population mobility

While CN migrant in HK has been widely discussed, there are extremely limited discussion about the HK migrant in CN. The only available literatures that give a glance at this matter are [Census and Statistics Department (2011)](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp160_tc.jsp?productCode=C0000027) and [Census and Statistics Department (2015)](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp160.jsp?productCode=C0000089)
While they are relatively dated reference, both have shown that HK labour has limited intention to work in CN in general.

Census and Statistics Department (2011) discuss the HK labour demographic that working in China. There was only about 5% of the total number of HK labour force used to work in CN, which declined from its peak in 2004 (7.6%) which had had also no significant growth on average from 1990 to 2010. Nearly 90% of the work/job take place in GuangDong Province.

Amid this particular labour force, over 70% are over 30, more than 2/3 did not received tertiary education; only less than 20% are employer, most (over 80%) them employee are management level and professionals in manufacturing and trade industry, over 50% of their wage level are over 20,000, while only around 20% of the Hong Kong labour force is paid at this wage level. Indeed, this particular labour forces income median is almost a double of the equivalent in the Hong Kong local labour market 20,000 and 11,000.

However, their employment period in China is ephemeral but constant, on average their stay period in China is less than 5 days but they are required to go to China to work at least once a week. It is understandable, since over 90% of them are employed by a HK company and their most frequent reason of working in China are job obligation and career prospect (about 90% and 20% respectively). Very limited agreement is found in China employment offers higher wage or either lower living cost (both less than 2%).

Despite there has been policies encourage interaction between HK and CN after 2011, HK resident is still rarely seen in the CN labour market. This observation is confirmed by Census and Statistics Department (2015), which investigated 10,100 HK household for the features of HK residents who stayed in China for a short period. After 5 years, using working as a reason to travel CN is still less than 10% is for, moreover education is nearly none (0.1%) whereas leisure or visiting family/relatives is dominating. It reflect that the CN employment opportunity is not appreciated by the HK labours. Moreover, this interaction are mainly contributed by the middle aged and elder, the youth participation were still relatively less.
