1. Literature review (on-going)
2. Search for research grants opportunities (started)

## Literature review

Find literature in journal or governmental documents recent 5 years with respect main 3 topics in the GBA context. Write a summary for each relevant literature, record their data source, see `./sys_lit_re/s_litre.pdf`

1. Migration, return to education
   1. Human capital: 5 found
   2. Migration: 9 found
   3. Return to Education: 7 found
2. Migrated children/student health and wellbeing: found: 8 found
3. Schools/governments support and policies reform

Total of 29 journal literature found.

In addition, I wrote a memo for the Labour interaction and mobility between GBA and HK Macau, mainly using the Census and Statistics Department, HKGov, see `./lit/memo.pdf`

## Research grants opportunities

The following is the on going GBA project in HK universities, funded by PICO, see [here](https://www.pico.gov.hk/en/PRFS/ppr-reports.html):

3. [ORKTS](https://www.orkts.cuhk.edu.hk/component/users/?view=login&Itemid=483) I do not have access yet.

I asked Erika (HKIER EO) for funding opportunities. While I doubt if there is any relevance of their funding opportunities, the following is the results:

1. [Quality Education Fund (QEF)](https://www.qef.org.hk/e_index.html)
2. [DHChen Foundation](https://dhchenfoundation.com/)

## Task self initiate

I wrote a web crawler to speed up the search of literature in the first week, see folder `./gsch_crawler/`.

## Difficulties

- Unclear objectives
  - Despite Prof Ou dedicating explanation, I can't grasp the big picture and understand what is the research initiative which slows down the work progress.
  - **What is the main question of the research project?**
- Little relevant literature in GBA context with respect to the assigned topics, there is plenty in country level, however.
  - GBA context literature publishes in [en.cnki.com.cn](en.cnki.com.cn) such as [A Study On Synergic Development Of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area](http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GHSI201804001.htm) which is rather rare source of reference.
- Web Development I have the following questions:
  1. What is the objective?
  2. Where is the material?
  3. Who are the members?
  4. What is the name of the centre?
