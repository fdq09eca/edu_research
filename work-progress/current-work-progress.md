## Web-development

Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the site generator

### Difficulties:

- Compatibility problem of Window and Linux.

### Framework

I propose the following themes[^1]. They are all responsive, i.e. it does not mess up with phone.

[Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/)

- Pros

  - Dropdown list navigation
  - Blog, ease for publishing latest new, if any.
  - Good documentation

- Cons

  - Plain appearance
  - Less maintained by the theme owner

[Minimal mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/), [Yellowcake](https://yellowcake.netlify.app/)

- Pros

  - Blog
  - Good documentation
  - I used it before, see [ERC website](https://erc.cuhk.edu.hk/)
  - Frequently maintained theme, robust and timely update
  - [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) and [Yellowcake](https://yellowcake.netlify.app/) come with official [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) content managment system (CMS)
    - Do not have to know how to code to maintain the site
    - [Minimal mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) CMS is written by me

- Cons

  - No Dropdown list navigation
  - [Minimal mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) are widely used theme (may not be bad)
    - see [here](https://www.cross-validated.com/index.html), [here](https://yosuketanigawa.com/), and [here](https://dseconf.org/about)
  - ~~[Yellowcake](https://yellowcake.netlify.app/) has copyright issue (solved)~~
    - ~~the top right corner has a github repo~~
    - ~~footer has copyright statement~~

[Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/agency/), [Event](https://msiastc.github.io/)

- Pros

  - Clean and Engaging theme
  - Team page available

- Cons

  - No Dropdown list navigation
  - No Blog
  - Poor documentation (I am ok with it though)
  - The structure of this theme is closer to html instead of compiling with a site generator convention. (all html)
