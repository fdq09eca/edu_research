## Web-development

Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the site generator

### Difficulties:

- Compatibility problem of Window and Linux.

### Framework

[Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/)

- Pros

  - Dropdown list navigation
  - Blog (ease for publishing latest new, if you have any.)
  - Good documentation

- Cons

  - Plain appearance
  - Less maintained by the theme owner

[Minimal mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

- Pros

  - Blog (ease for publishing latest news, if any.)
  - Good documentation
  - I used it before, see [ERC website](https://erc.cuhk.edu.hk/)
  - Frequently maintained theme, robust and timely update

- Cons

  - No Dropdown list navigation
  - Widely used theme (may not be bad), see [here](https://www.cross-validated.com/index.html), [here](https://yosuketanigawa.com/), and [here](https://dseconf.org/about)

[Event](https://msiastc.github.io/)

- Pros

  - Clean theme
  - Team page available

- Cons

  - No Dropdown list navigation
  - No Blog
  - Poor documentation (I am ok with it though)
  - The structure of this theme is closer to html instead of compiling with a site generator convention. (all html)
